On January 5, 2016 [Bret Victor tweeted](https://twitter.com/worrydream/status/684452792971341824) a [picture of his bookshelf](http://worrydream.com/Shelf2015/). I've catalogued all of the books, by topic, below. They cover a wide variety of subjects, and I think they're really interesting if you are a fan of Bret's work.
